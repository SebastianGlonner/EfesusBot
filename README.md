You need to add "jacob-1.19" folder to your PATH to support loading the jacob dlls.

Copy AutoItX3_x64.dll file. You can find it in C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\AutoItX.

Paste it in "jacob-1.19" (also in the windows PATH).

Open a cmd prompt, run as administrator. Type regsvr32 AutoItX3_x64.dll and press Enter.

You will get a message prompt as DllRegisterServer in AutoItX3_x64.dll succeeds.
